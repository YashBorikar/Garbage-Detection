# Garbage Detection
Garbage Detection System is built using Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network to detect real time Roadside Garbage, public place litter.

## Feature of Garbage Detection Model
Garbage Detection Model use Deep Neural Network with CNN architecture model for Image Classification.

Tensorflow-Keras Convolutional Neural Network with multiple layers is used to train and test model for Garbage Detection and has 84% accuracy to Detect Garbage after training.

Model can be used in real-time applications to detect road side garbage, public place litter to keep society clean and hygenic.
